| 4     | Transport        | Reliable delivery & flow control         | TCP, UDP                   |
| 3     | Network          | Routing & addressing                     | IP, ICMP, IPSec            |
| 2     | Data Link        | MAC address, frame delivery              | Ethernet, ARP, PPP         |
| 1     | Physical         | Hardware transmission of raw data        | Cables, NIC, Hubs          |

## üìò CIDR Notation (Quick Reference)

CIDR defines how many bits are used for the **network portion** of an IP address.

| CIDR  | Subnet Mask       | IPs in Range | Usable IPs |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| /8    | 255.0.0.0         | ~16.7M       | 16,777,214 |
| /16   | 255.255.0.0       | 65,536       | 65,534     |
| /24   | 255.255.255.0     | 256          | 254        |
| /30   | 255.255.255.252   | 4            | 2          |

üß† *Usable IPs = Total - 2 (Network & Broadcast IPs)*

## üîó IP Address Types

- **Private IPs (for internal use):**
  - Class A: 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255
  - Class B: 172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255
  - Class C: 192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255

- **Public IPs** are globally routable and assigned by ISPs.

## üß† Interview-Style Quick Q&A

**Q: What is the OSI Model?**  
A: A 7-layer architecture to standardize network communication.

**Q: What's the difference between TCP and UDP?**  
A: TCP is connection-oriented and reliable; UDP is faster but connectionless and less reliable.

**Q: How do you identify a private IP?**  
A: Check if it falls within the reserved private ranges.

**Q: What is CIDR?**  
A: Classless Inter-Domain Routing ‚Äî it determines how many bits are used for network in an IP.
