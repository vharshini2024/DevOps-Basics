CI – Continuous Integration
Imagine a group of developers working on the same app. Everyone writes code, right?
With CI, whenever someone finishes a piece of code, they push it to a shared place (like GitHub).
Then, automatically:
The code is checked
It is built (like packaging the app)
And tested to see if anything is broken
This happens every time someone updates the code.
✅ So, CI makes sure all the code works well together and we catch mistakes early.
🚀 CD – Continuous Delivery / Deployment
Now that the code is tested and ready, what’s next?
With CD, that tested code is:
Automatically sent to a staging or production environment
No need to do manual steps each time
There are two types:
Continuous Delivery – Code is ready to go live, but we press the final “Go” button manually.
Continuous Deployment – Code goes live automatically if it passes all the tests.

EXAMPLE :
1. Developer pushes code to Azure Repos / GitHub

     🔨 Build Pipeline (CI)
     ───────────────────────
     - Pulls the latest code
     - Restores dependencies
     - Builds the app
     - Runs unit tests
     - Publishes build artifacts (output)
                     │
                     ▼
     🚀 Release Pipeline (CD)
     ─────────────────────────
     - Picks the build artifact
     - Deploys to environments (Dev → QA → Prod)
     - Can include manual approvals
     - Can be automatic (Deployment) or manual (Delivery)
